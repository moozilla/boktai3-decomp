# Codex medium worker: task 080D6FDC

Tags: #matching #scene-actor #terrain #mummy #dog

Worked offline on the already-claimed cloud/080D6FDC branch. Only fast
`tools/check.py` compilations were used; no full build or network operations.
Commits were queued through `build/commit.sh`.

- **080DE57C — matched, Dog_ResetActionState (tentative).** Clears context
  flags at 0x678, timer 0x690, selection 0x6A0, timer 0x6A4, bytes 0x6A6/7
  and the eight-byte region at 0x6D8. Resolves the route position, selects
  directional animation entry zero and steps the drawable sequence.
  `Ivy_TickDrawable` (080F05E8) supplied the exact sequence stepper. Replacing
  raw context-offset casts with a narrow typed context removed all remaining
  constant-address and register differences. Exact checker: 336 bytes.
  Register-pinning concession retained from the stepper.
- **080DDEC8 — matched, Dog_RestoreRoute (tentative).** A close relative of
  `Golem_RestoreRoute` (080C4A9C): chase restoration uses delay 20 rather than
  30, and sets group+0x40 bit 4 after updating the capped chase timer.
  Addressing that flag through the group pointer reproduced the ROM's
  `mov r0, sb; adds r0, #0x40`; local r0/r1/r2 hints closed six remaining
  register differences. Exact checker: 608 bytes. Register-pinning concession.
- **080DE128 — matched, Dog_SelectTargetAction (tentative).** Called from
  080E3790. Within target range and a heading difference of at most 23,
  selects response 0x75 or 0x82 depending on actor+0x1E6, subject to context
  range 0x67C and timer 0x698. A tighter heading threshold of 5, range 0x680
  and timer 0x69A select response 0x87. Otherwise falls back to 080DF400
  unless context flag 8 is set. Preserving the two separate fallback checks
  and the shared inner failure label fixed block order. Register constraints
  prevented the 0x100 flag constant from being held across the heading
  calculation and reproduced the absolute-value result and final flag
  addresses. Exact checker: 772 bytes. Register-pinning concession.
- **080D6FDC — retained draft 80.6%, Mummy_RequestStraightRoute (tentative).**
  Started from the existing draft, added the required descriptive local
  alias, and re-recorded the score. Scans in facing order for the last open
  same-level cell, requests a route, and sets context+0x6D2 to 240 on success.
  The existing candidate still has 105 realigned differing instructions,
  17 ignoring registers. Passing an explicitly pinned map-address pointer
  through the terrain helpers and pinning the actor/cell/level worsened the
  candidate; those experiments remain outside src. The map address spill
  and larger stack frame remain the principal known differences.
- **080D9B20 — drafted 85.3%, SceneActor_FindDirectionalCell (existing name).**
  Keeps the current cell unless a requested cardinal neighbour passes a
  same-height and attribute-mask 0x43 check. Assembly repeats an adjacency
  predicate with four explicit branches. The draft preserves those tests,
  but agbcc merges the passability bodies and removes redundant intermediate
  booleans/cell comparisons: 681 realigned differing instructions, 574
  ignoring registers, over the full reviewed extent. Attempts using loops,
  separate boolean branches, and register constraints did not improve the
  retained candidate. This is a guarded fuzzy draft, not exact progress.
- **080D812C — stopped below draft threshold (46.5%).** Timed burn-damage
  update (proposed Mummy_UpdateBurnDamage, low confidence): actor-group timer
  0x1F0, periodic effects and sound, damage every 40 ticks, HUD/palette
  feedback, then defeat control and saturating category/reaction statistics.
  The actor action 0x15 extinguishes its effects. Matched routines
  08132D2C and 080EE1B0 supply most statistics code; 0813599C supplies the
  local-player HUD eligibility predicate. Candidate compiles but still has
  3051 realigned differing instructions, 193 ignoring registers. Extensive
  repeated counter blocks, scratch-register/pool layout and far-branch tails
  dominate. The Ghidra export is absent. Candidate stays in untracked wip;
  no below-threshold draft was added to src.

The three exact functions are all in the Register-pinned category. Guarded
scores were recorded with `tools/check.py --nonmatching --record`; their
normal build paths retain INCLUDE_ASM. No shared documentation was changed.

# Task 08131D5C — scene actor damage and defeat

Tags: #matching #scene-actor #damage #defeat-stats

Worked offline on the preclaimed cloud/08131D5C branch. Used only fast
`tools/check.py` compilations for validation; no make, full build or network.
Each function was committed separately through `build/commit.sh`.

- **08134398 — matched, SceneActorReaction_RecordDefeat.** Started with the
  existing guarded draft and read its matched sibling 08132D2C plus
  `notes/defeat-stats-template.md`. Rebuilding the opening from the sibling,
  dropping the contact-node release/group-link flag work and keeping the
  target's own reset fields gave the right behavior. The decisive change was
  the full-width signed bitfield for flags2D6: it creates separate SI/HI zero
  values before the halfword store, which makes the spill/reload register set
  match throughout the repeated statistics blocks. Passing the clear mask to
  a small inline puts the literal load before the halfword load. Counter
  increments retain two explicit stores and macros use plain braces rather
  than do/while wrappers. Exact reviewed extent: 5636 bytes. **No register
  pins remain** in this unit.
- **08132490 — matched, SceneActorReaction_ApplyCategoryDamage.** Called for
  actor categories 11/12/13 by SceneActorBehavior_DispatchFlaggedCategory
  (08132898). Applies reactionSoundVariant damage, palette/HUD/damage-number
  feedback, clears collision timers, and hides/redirects a defeated actor;
  surviving actors play song 0x13E. Started from the matched 08132748 defeat
  setup and 08135F70's damage-display predicate. Loading the damage into a
  local before subtracting fixed initial load order; changing the predicate's
  mask register from r3 to r2 closed the remaining allocation differences.
  Exact reviewed extent: 696 bytes. Register-pinning concession.
- **0813214C — matched, SceneActorReaction_ApplyStaggerDamage.** Sibling of
  08132490 for the dispatcher's default category path. Surviving actors enter
  control kind 0x21 with SceneActorReaction_PlayStaggerBurst; the final
  flags2CC bit 0x2000 is set on either health path. A signed full-width
  flags2D4 bitfield plus an inline mask parameter reproduced the early byte
  zero and halfword zero. A short r0 bit-mask constraint fixes the stagger
  flag OR order. Broader zero/collider pins caused unsafe-looking register
  overlap and were discarded. Exact reviewed extent: 836 bytes.
  Register-pinning concession.
- **08131D5C — drafted 85.4%, SceneActorReaction_ApplyAreaDamage.** Called by
  08135F70 when no pending hit exists. Requires enabled, clear flags2D0 bit 8,
  clear flags2CC bit 2 and zero collider responseValue. Gets damage from
  AreaEffect_ScaleGainAtPosition using the position and unsigned max health,
  applies it, generates two random knockback components, displays feedback,
  sets a 38-tick response timer and control kind 0x12 (or defeat kind 17).
  Candidate has 96 realigned differing instructions, 42 ignoring registers.
  Pointer spill placement, RNG expansion and load/store scheduling remain;
  the candidate is 12 bytes shorter than the 1008-byte original extent.
  Tried shared failure labels, call/output-pointer helpers, high-register
  hints, typed collider access, paired RNG expansion and bitfield OR forms.
  The typed collider/shared-failure candidate was retained; other experiments
  remain untracked under wip/med. Register-pinning concession in the common
  display predicate and short flag-mask lifetime.
- **08132904 — drafted 81.1%, SceneActorReaction_ApplyLinkedAreaDamage.**
  Shares the preceding area's damage flow, selecting
  AreaEffect_ScaleLinkGainAtPosition in link mode, and additionally clears
  flags2D4 bit 0x2000 after starting knockback. Candidate has 126 realigned
  differing instructions, 58 ignoring registers, and is 16 bytes shorter
  than the 1064-byte original extent. The same pointer/RNG issues remain.
  Register-pinning concession.
- **08135F70 — improved draft 86.8%, SceneActorReaction_ResolveDamage.**
  Resolves pending hit damage and flags, or falls back to 08131D5C for area
  damage. Added the required name and concession marker. Keeping mode in sl,
  preserving the constant one in sb across the HUD call, and constraining
  short-lived hit masks improved the existing 84.4% draft. Removing its old
  updated-value r5 pin reduces structural differences further: retained
  candidate has 79 realigned differing instructions, 18 ignoring registers.
  Health/flags2D8 pointer spills and the two inlined hit-flag expansions still
  differ; candidate is 1152 bytes versus the original 1156-byte extent.
  Forced stack barriers and output-pointer helpers worsened the structure
  and were discarded. Register-pinning concession.

All guarded scores were refreshed with `check.py --nonmatching --record`;
normal builds retain INCLUDE_ASM for the three drafts. Exact checks used
explicit reviewed extents for all three matches. Batch ROM validation and
name promotion are left to the integrator as instructed.
