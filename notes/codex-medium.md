# Codex medium worker: task 080D6FDC

Tags: #matching #scene-actor #terrain #mummy #dog

Worked offline on the already-claimed cloud/080D6FDC branch. Only fast
`tools/check.py` compilations were used; no full build or network operations.
Commits were queued through `build/commit.sh`.

- **080DE57C — matched, Dog_ResetActionState (tentative).** Clears context
  flags at 0x678, timer 0x690, selection 0x6A0, timer 0x6A4, bytes 0x6A6/7
  and the eight-byte region at 0x6D8. Resolves the route position, selects
  directional animation entry zero and steps the drawable sequence.
  `Ivy_TickDrawable` (080F05E8) supplied the exact sequence stepper. Replacing
  raw context-offset casts with a narrow typed context removed all remaining
  constant-address and register differences. Exact checker: 336 bytes.
  Register-pinning concession retained from the stepper.
- **080DDEC8 — matched, Dog_RestoreRoute (tentative).** A close relative of
  `Golem_RestoreRoute` (080C4A9C): chase restoration uses delay 20 rather than
  30, and sets group+0x40 bit 4 after updating the capped chase timer.
  Addressing that flag through the group pointer reproduced the ROM's
  `mov r0, sb; adds r0, #0x40`; local r0/r1/r2 hints closed six remaining
  register differences. Exact checker: 608 bytes. Register-pinning concession.
- **080DE128 — matched, Dog_SelectTargetAction (tentative).** Called from
  080E3790. Within target range and a heading difference of at most 23,
  selects response 0x75 or 0x82 depending on actor+0x1E6, subject to context
  range 0x67C and timer 0x698. A tighter heading threshold of 5, range 0x680
  and timer 0x69A select response 0x87. Otherwise falls back to 080DF400
  unless context flag 8 is set. Preserving the two separate fallback checks
  and the shared inner failure label fixed block order. Register constraints
  prevented the 0x100 flag constant from being held across the heading
  calculation and reproduced the absolute-value result and final flag
  addresses. Exact checker: 772 bytes. Register-pinning concession.
- **080D6FDC — retained draft 80.6%, Mummy_RequestStraightRoute (tentative).**
  Started from the existing draft, added the required descriptive local
  alias, and re-recorded the score. Scans in facing order for the last open
  same-level cell, requests a route, and sets context+0x6D2 to 240 on success.
  The existing candidate still has 105 realigned differing instructions,
  17 ignoring registers. Passing an explicitly pinned map-address pointer
  through the terrain helpers and pinning the actor/cell/level worsened the
  candidate; those experiments remain outside src. The map address spill
  and larger stack frame remain the principal known differences.
- **080D9B20 — drafted 85.3%, SceneActor_FindDirectionalCell (existing name).**
  Keeps the current cell unless a requested cardinal neighbour passes a
  same-height and attribute-mask 0x43 check. Assembly repeats an adjacency
  predicate with four explicit branches. The draft preserves those tests,
  but agbcc merges the passability bodies and removes redundant intermediate
  booleans/cell comparisons: 681 realigned differing instructions, 574
  ignoring registers, over the full reviewed extent. Attempts using loops,
  separate boolean branches, and register constraints did not improve the
  retained candidate. This is a guarded fuzzy draft, not exact progress.
- **080D812C — stopped below draft threshold (46.5%).** Timed burn-damage
  update (proposed Mummy_UpdateBurnDamage, low confidence): actor-group timer
  0x1F0, periodic effects and sound, damage every 40 ticks, HUD/palette
  feedback, then defeat control and saturating category/reaction statistics.
  The actor action 0x15 extinguishes its effects. Matched routines
  08132D2C and 080EE1B0 supply most statistics code; 0813599C supplies the
  local-player HUD eligibility predicate. Candidate compiles but still has
  3051 realigned differing instructions, 193 ignoring registers. Extensive
  repeated counter blocks, scratch-register/pool layout and far-branch tails
  dominate. The Ghidra export is absent. Candidate stays in untracked wip;
  no below-threshold draft was added to src.

The three exact functions are all in the Register-pinned category. Guarded
scores were recorded with `tools/check.py --nonmatching --record`; their
normal build paths retain INCLUDE_ASM. No shared documentation was changed.
